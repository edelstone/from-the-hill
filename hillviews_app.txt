Dear Hillviews Reader,

We want to share some exciting news about Hillviews, the official publication of Texas State University. We've launched a free digital version of the magazine, which has the same content from the printed publication, plus video links, additional photos, audio and a digital archive.

The print edition is available to Alumni Association and Family Association members and also individuals who donate a minimum of $500 over two years to Texas State. To join the associations, visit ua.txstate.edu/campus-connections.

To make a gift to Texas State, go to donate.txstate.edu.

Hillviews can be accessed on laptops, tablets or mobile devices. Just go to ua.txstate.edu/campus-connections/hillviews.html.

Sincerely,

Matt Flores
Editor
